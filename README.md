## 🛠️ **Under the Hood: Tech Stack**

We've combined cutting-edge web technologies with a powerful OCR engine to bring you this seamless experience:

|   Frontend         |   Backend        |   OCR Engine                  |
|   :--------------- |   :------------- |   :-------------------------- |
|   HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox |   Flask (Python) |   Tesseract OCR (`pytesseract`) |

The clean and responsive frontend, crafted with HTML5, CSS3, and Flexbox, ensures a delightful user experience across devices. Behind the scenes, Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, manages the server-side logic. The core of the text extraction is powered by Tesseract OCR, accessed through the `pytesseract` Python library.

## ⚙️ **How It Works: A Simple Workflow**

1.  **Image Upload:** You select and upload an image file containing text.
2.  **Visual Preview:** The uploaded image is displayed, allowing you to confirm your selection.
3.  **Initiate Extraction:** Clicking the "EXTRACT" button sends the image to our OCR engine.
4.  **Text Revelation:** The extracted text is processed and beautifully presented alongside the original image.
5.  **Start Afresh:** The "RESET" button clears both the image and the extracted text, preparing the app for your next task.
